# Permission-Description Fidelity Analyzer

*Overview*: This tool analyzes Android applications (APKs) to identify requested permissions and assess the fidelity of permission descriptions using a fine-tuned BERT model. The analysis involves decompiling the APKs, processing the app descriptions, and predicting potential requested permissions based on the app's description.

For example letâ€™s say the model can predict xyz permissions. Based on an application description the model predicts the app is using x and y permissions. But within the manifest we see the app is requesting x, y and z permissions. This would be a permission-description fidelity issue. Hence a gap between the requested permissions and the permissions a user would expect via reading the apps description.

The fine-tuned model can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/etham13/permissions_bert_uncased/settings)

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Huggingface login token

## Setup

1. Install the required dependencies in gdpr_test_bed/PTs/requirements.txt
2. Replace the placeholder HF token in the `login` function with your Hugging Face token (commented out by default).

## Usage

1. Update the `apk_files_PT2.csv` file with the names and paths of the APKs to analyze.
2. Run the script using the command:

```bash
python permission.py
```

## Output

### 1. `sentences_with_predictions.csv`

This file contains detailed results for each app, including the app ID, individual sentences from the app's description, and the predicted permissions based on the model's inference.

| app_id         | sentence                                      | predictions   |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| app| "record and track your snoring with the no.1 snore app." | ['MICROPHONE'] |

### 2. `permission_description_fidelity_results.csv`

This file provides a summary of permission fidelity for each app, indicating whether there is a permission description fidelity (PFD) detected. It includes the app name and a boolean value (True/False) representing the presence of PFD.

| app_name         | permission_description_fidelity |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------- |
| app | True                            |

In the example above, an app has a detected permission description fidelity. 

### 3. `meta_data.csv`

This file contains five columns: *app_name, requested_filtered_permissions, permission_gap, predicted_permissions, all_requested_permissions*.

 - *Filtered_requested_permissions* gathers the permissions out of the manifest file and only keeps the permissions the model can predict.

 - *All_requested_permissions* returns ALL permissions requested within the apps manifest file, even if the model was not fine tuned to predict them.

 - *Predicted_permissions* is the output from the fine tuned model.

 - *Permission_gap* shows if there are permissions that were requested within the manifest file but were not detected by the model.
